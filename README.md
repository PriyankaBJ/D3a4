1. Explain the importance of Namenode in Hadoop cluster.

Importance of NameNode:

The hadoop cluster mainly comprises of:

The NameNode is the master daemon in HDFS.
It stores metadata about the data stored in the hadoop file system.
It is single point of failure  and the hadoop storage is managed by the Namenode.
The namenode is responsible for the synchronization between the data nodes.
Whenever a file is placed in the hadoop cluster a corresponding entry of it location is 
maintained by the NameNode.
and hence to ensure the high availability of data in HDFS namenode plays very important role.
